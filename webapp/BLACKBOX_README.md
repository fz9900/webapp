Sure, I can do that. Here is the README.md file for the Flask login app:

## Flask Login App

This is a simple Flask app that demonstrates how to implement user login and logout functionality.

### Prerequisites

To run this app, you will need the following:

* Python 3.6 or later
* Flask
* Flask-Login

### Installation

To install the dependencies, run the following command:

```
pip install flask flask-login
```

### Running the App

To run the app, run the following command:

```
python app.py
```

The app will be available at http://localhost:5000/.

### User Login

To log in, visit the login page at http://localhost:5000/login. Enter your username and password, and click the "Login" button.

If you are logged in successfully, you will be redirected to the home page at http://localhost:5000/dashboard.

### User Logout

To log out, visit the logout page at http://localhost:5000/logout.

You will be logged out and redirected to the login page.

### Code Snippets

Here are some code snippets from the app:

* The `app.py` file contains the main Flask app.

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, request, redirect, url_for

app = Flask(__name__)

# Replace this with actual user authentication logic
def is_authenticated(username, password):
    return username == 'admin' and password == 'admin'

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return redirect('/login')

@app.route('/login', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def login():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        username = request.form['username']
        password = request.form['password']

        if is_authenticated(username, password):
            return redirect(url_for('dashboard', username=username))
        else:
            error = "Invalid credentials. Please try again."
            return render_template('login.html', error
